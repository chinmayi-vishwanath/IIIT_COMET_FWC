\item In fig. 5, a tent is in the shape of a cylinder surmounted by a conical top of same diameter. If the height and diameter of cylindrical part are $2.1$ m and $3$ m respectively and the slant height of conical part is $2.8$ m, find the cost of canvas needed to make the tent if the canvas is available at the rate of Rs.\ 500 per sq. metre. (Use $\pi = \dfrac{22}{7}$)

\item If the point $P(x, y)$ is equidistant from the points $A(a+b,\, b-a)$ and $B(a-b,\, a+b)$, prove that $bx = ay$.

\item In fig. 6, find the area of the shaded region, enclosed between two concentric circles of radii $7$ cm and $14$ cm where $\angle AOC = 40^\circ$. (Use $\pi = \dfrac{22}{7}$)

\item If the ratio of the sum of first $n$ terms of two A.P.'s is $(7n+1):(4n+27)$, find the ratio of their $n^{\text{th}}$ terms.

\item Solve for \(x\):
\[
\frac{1}{(x-1)(x-2)} + \frac{1}{(x-2)(x-3)} = \frac{2}{3}, \quad x \neq 1,2,3
\]

\item A conical vessel, with base radius 5 cm and height 24 cm, is full of water. This water is emptied into a cylindrical vessel of base radius 10 cm. Find the height to which the water will rise in the cylindrical vessel. (Use $\pi = \dfrac{22}{7}$)

\item A sphere of diameter 12 cm is dropped in a right circular cylindrical vessel partly filled with water. If the sphere is completely submerged, the water level in the cylindrical vessel rises by $3\frac{5}{9}$ cm. Find the diameter of the cylindrical vessel.

\item A man standing on the deck of a ship, which is 10 m above water level, observes the angle of elevation of the top of a hill as $60^\circ$ and the angle of depression of the base as $30^\circ$. Find the distance of the hill from the ship and the height of the hill.

\item Three different coins are tossed together. Find the probability of getting:  
(i) exactly two heads,  
(ii) at least two heads,  
(iii) at least two tails.
